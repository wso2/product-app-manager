# WSO2 Puppet Modules

This repository contains generic Puppet modules for installing and configuring WSO2 products on various environments. Each puppet module supports multiple versions of a WSO2 product. Configuration data is managed using [Hiera] (http://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/1/). Hiera provides a mechanism for separating configuration data from Puppet scripts and managing them in a separate set of YAML files in a hierarchical manner.
